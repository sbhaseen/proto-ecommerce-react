# React and NestJS E-commerce Starter

A full stack web application for a typical e-commerce use case scenario built with React, NestJS and TypeScript.

Although built as a demonstrantion project, it is hoped that it can be of use to anybody seeking to quickly prototype a custom e-commerce solution.

React TypeScript best practices are applied as recommended by [React TypeScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react).

# Key Features:

## Custom Contexts

`src/contexts`

### AuthContext

Provides a top level context to handle authenticaion via a back end API and exposes values that can be consumed by child components.

- Register a new user and login
- Login an authenticated user
- Logout
- Modify user data (CRUD operations via back end API)

### CartContext

Provides a top level context to handle shopping cart functionality that exposes values that can be consumed by child components.

- Add an item
- Remove an item
- Checkout all items in cart

## Custom Hooks

`src/hooks`

### useLocalStorage

A hook to set and retrieve local storage items.

## Styles

Uses React-Bootstrap `npm` distribution.
Any additional styling can be found in a component's associated css module file.

## Data Handling

Uses the [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library `npm` distribution to perfrom API requests in the front end.

## Authentication

Implements a local strategy using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with the Passport library and NestJS integrations.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
